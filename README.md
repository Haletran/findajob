=> [The Website](https://haletran.github.io/findajob/)

Simple website to maybe find an Internship or an Apprenticeship for my RNCP (I hope...)

Currently, it only lists jobs in `AngoulÃªme`, so the results are quite limited. I plan to add more cities soon.

> Keep in mind it was made in ~1h so don't excpect too much (thks Claude for the css)
